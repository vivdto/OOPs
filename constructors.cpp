/* Constructor is a member function of a class that initializes objects of a class. In C++, Constructor is automatically called when an object (instance of the class) is created. It is a special member function of the class.

How constructors are different from a normal member function?


A constructor differs from member-functions in the following ways:

Constructor has the same name as the Class itself.
Constructors donâ€™t have a return type.
A Constructor is automatically called when an object is created.
If we do not specify a constructor, 

C++ compiler generates a default constructor for us (expects no parameters and has an empty body).


Default Constructor


It is not mandatory for the programmer to write a constructor for each class. C++ by default provides a default constructors with no parameters, and no statements for the body. Much like being:

Employee() {}   //as per our example
